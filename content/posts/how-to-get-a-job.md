## My way until now

My dad is a self-employed IT-Consultant, mainly focused on private persons to small businesses, everything from hardware and network/telephone wiring to software and service. Also some cozy, never-think-about mail and webhosting. I helped here and there, mainly focused on the hosting and everything related to Apple.

I started computer science in 2014 at the TU Dortmund, right next to my city, started to slow down my pace sometime but doing all the things, I saw some sense in for the practical future: Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, programming classes and even functional programming in Haskell, but really tuck away from the heavy math stuff. 

So this fall I got to a point where I really didn't have any motivation to continue this study.

But doing nothing isn't really an option, right?

So i started looking out for entry-level jobs...

## Talking. In Person

*not my favorite thing to do, but...*

After sending out some halfbaked applications for jobs for non-frontend, no java positions, i talked to a relative of a good friend and he told me about Meetups. Never heard about this before...

So since I have some interest in Docker, I went to a Docker meetup and eventually got in touch with the head of [bee42](bee42.com).

We talked there shortly, he told me to come over next week and we talked about two hours about Raspberrys, Docker, and of course what I can do for them. This was on a friday, the week after he send me an exercise, after starting with a big questionmark on my forehead i managed to make it work and now, I'm there, starting as a working student for the next three months. After that time, we will see how much I've learned and if I can contribute enough to work full-time.

## TL ; DR

**Talk to the people ! You can't summarize yourself on two pages**
