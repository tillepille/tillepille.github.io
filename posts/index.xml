      <description>My way until now My dad is a self-employed IT-Consultant, mainly focused on private persons to small businesses, everything from hardware and network/telephone wiring to software and service. Also some cozy, never-think-about mail and webhosting. I helped here and there, mainly focused on the hosting and everything related to Apple.
I started computer science in 2014 at the TU Dortmund, right next to my city, started to slow down my pace sometime but doing all the things, I saw some sense in for the practical future: Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, programming classes and even functional programming in Haskell, but really tuck away from the heavy math stuff.</description>

      <description>about browsers und speedtests
Internet of Speeds Since I got a Gigabit Connection at home over DOCSIS 3.1 (at least Downsteam, Upstream is 50MBit), i like too see how fast my internet is. When your alone there arenâ€˜t really many use cases where you need such a fast connection.
But beside seeing the speeds on the interface of the router, eventually it was difficult to test the actual speeds.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;write a blog!&amp;rdquo; they said&amp;hellip; Okay, so here I am. Or at least my blog.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science student, i do it on github rather than on tumblr&amp;hellip; As you can see, powered with hugo and currently no Pipeline.. :(</description>
